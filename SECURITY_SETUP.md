# Security Setup Guide

This guide covers additional security configurations that cannot be applied via database migrations.

## üîê Enable Leaked Password Protection

Supabase Auth can check passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned database to prevent users from using compromised passwords.

### How to Enable:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/onigvijfusxtycronhhm

2. **Open Authentication Settings**
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Policies" or "Settings"

3. **Enable Password Protection**
   - Look for "Password Protection" or "Security" section
   - Enable "Check passwords against HaveIBeenPwned"
   - This option may also be called "Leaked Password Protection"

4. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" or "Update"

### What This Does:

- ‚úÖ Prevents users from creating accounts with compromised passwords
- ‚úÖ Checks against 600+ million leaked passwords from HaveIBeenPwned.org
- ‚úÖ Improves overall account security
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (checked only during signup/password change)

### Alternative (If not available in UI):

If the option isn't visible in the dashboard, you can enable it via the Supabase Management API:

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/onigvijfusxtycronhhm/config/auth' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "SECURITY_UPDATE_PASSWORD_REQUIRE_REAUTHENTICATION": true,
    "PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH": 8,
    "SECURITY_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_CHARACTERS": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789",
    "SECURITY_PASSWORD_CHECKS": ["haveibeenpwned"]
  }'
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual access token from the Supabase dashboard.
